Deployment: Follow this along with install.aws.rdoc and notes

1) Deploy chef-server to EC2 (delete the current .chef folder)
  - runs into a few errors specifically when uploading cookbooks - can ignore for now (but will have to fix later) 
  - if you didn't delete the current .chef folder, if will create a .chef.bak folder (backup) and move the current content over
  - to fix cookbooks, need to modify etc/chef_server/chef_server.rb (see below) then reupload all cookbooks
          
          ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2-cc-chef.pem ubuntu@54.163.162.177

          cd /etc/chef-server
          sudo touch chef-server.rb
          sudo vim chef-server.rb

          server_name = "54.163.162.177"
          api_fqdn server_name
          nginx['url'] = "https://#{server_name}"
          nginx['server_name'] = server_name
          lb['fqdn'] = server_name
          bookshelf['vip'] = server_name


          quit vim
          run: sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure

          back in console: knife cookbook upload -a


  - once all this is done, can login to chef-server using user admin pass: ripelink (after you reset it)

2) Deploy cloud-master ("CC_Master")
  - uses configuration from chef-server
    - if error "your validation client is not authorized...." occurs, 
      open chef-server web and delete client "CC-Master"
      also delete all amazon EC2 instances 
      possibly run knife node delete "CC-Master" (don't actually think this does anything if you did above 2)
