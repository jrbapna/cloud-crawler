add it to the queue

spawn a new worker and attach it to the queue



Create and assign worker to most underutilized EC2 Instance

If CPU utilization of EC2 worker fleet > 70%, instantiate new instance
If CPU utilization of EC2 worker fleet < 10%, remove EC2 instance

Always keep at least one instance

Each worker will have 5 threads


If Auto Scaling kills an EC2 instance that hasn't finishing processing a certain site, just run a cron job on 
Master that automatically spawns new workers for queues that have zero active workers but still have jobs to run


Or, only kill the instance once all of the jobs are done



Every domain must have a count of links 






when worker is done, let ripelink know

(worker automatically kills itself)

ripelink generates report, sends user email, cleans up redis

user logs in and views all their links that are bad. they can then select which links they want to hide


on redis, we keep track of bad links, destroy everything else
